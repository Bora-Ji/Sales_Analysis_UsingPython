# Sales_Analysis_UsingPython
Basic Analysis on 12 month sales data Using Python

This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover trends, high-performing products, and customer purchasing patterns. The goal is to derive insights that can support business decisions using tools like **Power BI**, **Microsoft Excel**, and **MySQL**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify top-selling products
- Determine peak sales months
- Understand product bundling patterns
- Visualize data for better decision-making

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – for creating interactive dashboards
- **Excel** – for cleaning and exploring data
- **MySQL** – for data querying and manipulation
- **Python (optional)** – for advanced data processing (if used)

## 📁 Data Source
- The dataset is based on sales records of an electronics store
- Contains fields like `Order ID`, `Product`, `Quantity Ordered`, `Price Each`, `Order Date`, and `Purchase Address`

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- **Monthly Sales Trend** – Identified which months had the highest revenue
- **Top Products Sold** – Found which products were most popular by quantity
- **Product Bundles** – Discovered frequently bought-together product pairs
- **Sales by City** – Analyzed which cities brought the most revenue

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)
- Monthly Revenue Chart
- Product vs. Quantity Sold Bar Graph
- Dual-Axis Chart for Product Price vs. Sales Volume
- Interactive Filters for City, Product, and Time Period

## 📌 Insights
- iPhone and accessories like charging cables were often sold together
- December had the highest sales due to holiday shopping
- Cities with higher population density had more purchases

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Power BI and import the dataset
2. Load and clean the data using Power Query
3. Build the visuals using bar charts, line graphs, slicers, and cards
4. Use Excel or MySQL to validate trends and calculate aggregates if needed

## 🧠 Learnings
- Developed skills in Power BI dashboarding and data modeling
- Learned how to use Power Query for data transformation
- Practiced SQL for data analysis
- Gained hands-on experience in sales data interpretation
